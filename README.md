            'driver'   => 'Pdo_Mysql',
            'username' => 'root',
            'password' => 'password',
            'charset'  => 'utf8',
            'hostname' => 'localhost',
            'database' => 'sakila'];
$adapter = new \Rebelo\Db\Adapter\Adapter($config);
$result  = $adapter->select()->from("actor")->fetch();
```

Get only the first row of a query with method fetchRow 
```php
$result  = $adapter->select("actor")->fetchRow();
```

Get only the first column of the first row with method fetchOne
```php
$result  = $adapter->select("actor")
            ->columns([
                new \Zend\Db\Sql\Expression("COUNT(*)")])
            ->fetchOne();
```
Get rows with limit
```php
$result  = $adapter->select("actor")
            ->limit(5)->offset(1)
            ->fetch();
```

Insert a row
```php
$adapter->insert("language")->values([
            "language_id" => "9",
            "name"        => "PT"
        ])->execute();
```
Update a row

                "name" => "Portuguese"])
            ->where([
                "language_id" => 9])
            ->execute();
```

```php
$adapter->delete("language")->where([
                "language_id" => 9])
            ->execute();
```
Transactions
```php
$adapter->beginTransaction();
$result = $adapter->select("film")->fetchOne();
$result2 = $adapter->select()->from("city")
            ->where([
